Experimenting with discretizations of SDEs on Reimannian Manifolds

State Space discretizations of SDEs usually perform better than time discretizations, at least in the Euclidean settings (MCAM approach). What happens to the MCAM approach when expanded to Reimannian Manifolds? 

- [] Spherical Manifolds
- [] Compact Manifolds
- [] Topological Vector Spaces
